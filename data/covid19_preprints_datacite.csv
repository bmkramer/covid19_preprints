Nearly 8 Crore people are in the state. Simply, it is a dense state; having four cosmopolitan cities. Lots of men and women are working abroad all over the world and it has caused the pandemic to let into the state after China and other countries send back the migrant employers to their native country. Tamil Nadu even in the corner of the nation got chiefly afflicted by the inward transportation of the people in the country. Many north Indian people has been doing business come amass for their business. Kerala the adjacent state of the Tamil Nadu has registered the first case because of its international exposure in airways. Slowly, it got speeded into the nation in all sides of the country and has come to a hiked state. The purpose of the article is to give a comprehensive study of the emergence and the present state of COVID-19 affected in Tamil Nadu, India from the start to 4.4.2020. It also suggests some precautionary measures to avoid such catastrophic end faced by the developed countries.</i>"

A major question is thus: Can the unusual predictability of the infections’ timing be utilized to mitigate the imminent infection’s length, severity, and probability of complications? We suggest that priming the immune system for attack shortly before it is expected to occur, e.g. via a vaccine that elicits a broad anti-viral immune response, may have this desired effect. Early activation of the immune system would allow it to clear the infection faster and with less complications than otherwise. This would alleviate adverse clinical outcomes at the individual level, and mitigate population-level risk by reducing need for hospitalizations and decreasing the infectious period of individuals, thus slowing the epidemic’s spread and reducing its impact."

While most of the inference works focused on viral genome sequence comparison, studies on the diversity of the Angiotensin I Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), the wildly recognized receptor for viral infection, has been limited in possible animal hosts. In this study, we analyzed the sequence divergence of ACE2 in the viral binding sites from bats, snakes, alligators, carnivores, even toe animals, rodents, nonhuman primates and humans. Our results showed that the viral binding sites in the ACE2 receptors are diverse between human and other animal species. In contrast, the protein sequences of the MERS receptor CD26 have only one amino acid difference between camel and human (camel V, human T). These analysis indicates complexity of the development of the infection mechanism of 2019-nCov and challenges in identifying the intermediate host(s) solely by bioinformatics approaches. Therefore, well-designed clinical studies and laboratory experiments are needed to determine the spreading path of 2019-nCov.</b><br>"

Healthcare systems struggle to monitor and report current cases. Limited capabilities in testing result in difficult to guide policies and mitigate lack of preparation. Since severe cases, which more likely lead to fatal outcomes, are detected at a higher percentage than mild cases, the reported death rates are likely inflated in most countries. Such under-estimation can be attributed to under-sampling of infection cases and results in systematic death rate estimation biases.The method proposed here utilizes a benchmark country (South Korea) and its reported death rates in combination with population demographics to correct the reported COVID-19 case numbers. By applying a correction, we predict that the number of cases is highly under-reported in most countries. In the case of China, it is estimated that more than 700.000 cases of COVID-19 actually occurred instead of the confirmed 80,932 cases as of 3/13/2020."

Since then, there have been repeated reports of eye infections. Of course, the eye effects of human infections with CoVs in general have not been widely studied. However, CoVs are known to cause various eye infections in animals.On January 30, the World Health Organization (WHO) 3 issued an emergency international public health warning (PHEIC) [5]. It included a set of recommendations for personal protective equipment (PPE) based on the experience of previous epidemics, such as Previous MERS-CoV4 and SARS-CoV [1,6]. This batch of proposals includes the use of goggles or face shield to protect against eye transmission of CoV. However, it remains interesting that the data on eye transmission have not been thoroughly studied.

It comprises a longitudinal cohort of around 500,000 people from the United Kingdom beginning in 2006, with detailed information on lifestyle and host genetic factors, with longitudinal follow-up through linkage to health administrative records. Public Health England’s Second Generation Surveillance System is a centralized microbiology database covering English clinical diagnostics laboratories that provides national surveillance of legally notifiable infections, bacterial isolations and antimicrobial resistance. We have already successfully established secure, anonymized, individual-level linkage of these systems. In this study, we implemented rapid dynamic linkage to provide a daily feed of new infection records with the aim of piloting the feasibility of prospective sampling of microbiological cultures from UK Biobank participants to create a microbiological biobank (‘bugbank’) for studying the interaction of environment, human and microbial genetics on infection. In light of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic, we have repurposed the system to provide UK Biobank researchers with rapid and regular information on COVID-19 test results to facilitate investigation of the environmental and human genetic risk factors for severe infection."

Figshare,10.6084/m9.figshare.12019035,2020-03-23,How blood group A might be a risk and blood group O be protected from coronavirus (COVID-19) infections,"When according to the numbers of Wikipedia (although they might be disputed) in countries like Chile, Ecuador, Colombia, Simbabwe and Mexico 59 to 85 percent of the people have blood group O and these countries officially publish extremely low COVID-19 cases and death rates per 1 million inhabitants, this may not alone result from insufficient investigations but might suggest a lower susceptibility of blood group O to the disease. The molecular biology of a virus infection pathogenesis determines the genetic target and the human phenotype-determining enzymes decide about the difference between infection and disease. In the case that <i>O</i>-glycosylation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of coronavirus infections, as was discussed already 14 years ago in a SARS-CoV virus infection and is currently again predicted for SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19, this would involve the formation of hybrid, serologically A-like, <i>O</i>-GalNAcα1-Ser/Thr-R, Tn (“T nouvelle”) antigenic structures; the virus hypothetically hijacks the metabolism of the host's amino sugar N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (GalNAc) by serine-rich peptides. The resulting intermediate, evolutionary/developmental A-like/Tn structure, which is common to all metazoan growth processes and apparently acts as a host-pathogen functional bridge in different, unrelated infectious diseases, would perform the adhesion of the virus to host cells primarily independent of the ABO blood group. However, apart from the fact that susceptibility to an infection and its severity depend on many factors, individuals with blood group A could not respond with either acquired or innate antibodies to the synthesis of A-like hybrid structures due to clonal selection and phenotypic accommodation of plasma proteins; blood group A individuals would become a preferred target for the virus, which utilizes the ACE receptor-mediated, blood group A-phenotype-determining enzyme activity and performs a further (blood group-A-specific) hybrid binding. In fact, a first statistical study suggests that people with blood group A have a significantly higher risk for acquiring COVID-19, whereas people with blood group O have a significantly lower risk for the infection compared with non-O blood groups (Zhao, J. <i>et al., </i>2020). While these findings await confirmations, blood group O individuals, lacking the blood group-A-determining enzyme, may develop the least molecular contact with the virus and maintain the anti-A/Tn cross-reactive, complement-dependent isoagglutinin activity, which is exerted by the polyreactive, nonimmune immunoglobulin M (IgM), representing the humoral spearhead of innate immunity and a first line of defense.<b>Reference</b>: Zhao, J. <i>et al.</i> Relationship between the ABO Blood Group and the COVID-19 Susceptibility. <i>medRxiv</i> (2020) doi:10.1101/2020.03.11.20031096.<br>"

Viruses can infect all types of life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, including bacteria and archaea. In evolution, viruses are an important means of horizontal gene transfer, which increases genetic diversity in a way analogous to sexual reproduction. Influenza (Including (COVID-19), is an infectious disease caused by an influenza virus. Some viruses especially smallpox, throughout history, has killed between 300-500 million people in its 12,000year existence. As modern humans increased in numbers, new infectious diseases emerged, including SARS-CoV-2. We have two groups of virus, RNA and DNA viruses. The most brutal viruses are RNA ones like COVID-19 (Sars-CoV-2 [1] Introduction: Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans, coronaviruses cause respiratory tract infections that are typically mild, such as some cases of the common cold (among other possible causes, predominantly rhinoviruses), though rarer forms can be lethal, such as SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. Symptoms vary in other species: in chickens, they cause an upper respiratory tract disease, while in cows and pigs they cause diarrhea. Coronaviruses constitute the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, The genome size, coronaviruses ranges from approximately 27 to 34 kilobases, the largest among known RNA viruses. Discussions and Results: We have researched from the first virus in the planet to the last mutated version which is SARS-COV-2. We have collected many informative data in tables and figures to reach the main cause of 2019Coronavirus and calculated the probability and estimated deaths in the current time. We have discussed about the possible treatment and prevention of the virus and did algebraic calculations on the epidemiology, the size and even the future of this pandemic. The only era which any virus had not been epidemic, were through world war 2, were the German scientists had found the way to fight any viral infections which is very important and can help scientists to reach the main treatment of the new 2019-Coronavirus. We have sorted the deadly and non-deadly coronaviruses and explained how this epidemic had begun through Evolutionary Medicine (EM). The result of the article is that 16% of the whole population in the world has been contaminated which is 1248000000 of 7.8 billion people world-wide. SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA Virus. its nucleic acid is <br>2 <br> <br>single-stranded RNA (ssRNA). The polarity of this virus is positive-sense ((+) ssRNA). Positivesense viral RNA is similar to mRNA and thus can be immediately translated by the host cell. Recombination in RNA viruses appears to be an adaptation for coping with genome damage. Recombination can occur infrequently between animal viruses of the same species but of divergent lineages. The resulting recombinant viruses may sometimes cause an outbreak of infection in humans. RNA viruses have very high mutation rates This is one reason why it is difficult to make effective vaccines to prevent diseases caused by RNA viruses. The resulting recombinant viruses causes an outbreak of infection in humans. Conclusion: In conclusion, the mutation of the SARSCoV and influenza viruses through Drift and Reassortment is the main cause of SARS-CoV-2 through natural selection, Lamarckian Evolution and coevolution which caused this RNA virus so powerful, unpredicted and different in the genome size and nations worldwide. The first Pandemic of Influenza was first detected in 1732 and this virus evolved through natural selection till 2019 which caused the worldwide pandemic of SARS-CoV-2. Based on many studies, inhalation of Ozone plus Sulfur Dioxide, increasing the amounts of L-Glutathione (Which is low in children and older adults and this is the main reason why older adults and children die from this disease.) plus Viral Phage Therapy (VPT) which we discussed fully in this article can be the possible prime treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The seasonal temperature cannot be useful in controlling/reducing the pandemic of this virus since the natural selection, Lamarckian Evolution and high mutation of the virus helps its survival. No antiviral drugs will be useful against SARSCoV-2 because of high rate of mutation and primarily adaptation of the virus to the drugs and even the environmental Temperature."

Zenodo,10.5281/zenodo.3744877,2020-04-08,A uniform assessment of an effect of medicinal plants using a combination of RNA-seq experiments and text mining of biomedical bibliographies,BACKGROUND<br> An efficiency if herbal medicine is possibly underestimated due to confusions in a choice between multiple approaches and terminologies. The availability of RNA seq experiments together with a volume if scientific publications related to medicinal plants makes it possible to develop a framework for a uniform assess of an expected effect of medicinal plants on a particular disease. <br> METHODS<br> Text mining of biomedical bibliographies was used to associate medicinal plants with a regulation of some genes in human genome. Publicly available RNA seq experiments were processed to determine changes in gene expression for some of human diseases. Grouping of genes and reduction of expression profiles within each group was used to bind changes in genes for a medicinal plant with an overall changes of expression in a state of a disease. RESULTS<br> The tables of an expected effect are provided for above 500 medicinal plants applied to the processed series of RNA-seq experiments. A model of coronavirus infection is presented as a case study for possible interpretation of the provided estimates.
Zenodo,10.5281/zenodo.3732292,2020-03-29,Adjoint-based Data Assimilation of an Epidemiology Model for the Covid-19 Pandemic in 2020,"Data assimilation is used to optimally fit a classical epidemiology model to the Johns Hopkins data of the Covid-19 pandemic. The optimisation is based on the confirmed cases and confirmed deaths. This is the only data available with reasonable accuracy. Infection and recovery rates can be infered from the model as well as the model parameters. The parameters can be linked with government actions or events like the end of the holiday season. Based on this numbers predictions for the future can be made and control targets specified. With other words: <strong>We look for a solution to a given model which fits the given<br> data in an optimal sense. Having that solution, we have all<br> parameters.</strong>"
Zenodo,10.5281/zenodo.3724834,2020-03-23,An estimate of total active cases of COVID-19 based on number of announced deaths in a given region,"Considering the exponential nature of the spread of COVID-19, the Infected Fatality Rate, and the mean time to death, it is possible to estimate a more realist number of total active cases – in contrast to the reported confirmed cases – based on the number of deaths announced in a given day in a region. In an example we have the number of active cases estimated in 1600 times the number of new deaths in that day. This can be useful to provide better resouce allocations."

We focus on Delaware as the prototypical jurisdiction, and examine 1) early coordination between public health and health law prior to any confirmed cases in the state, 2) the evolution of a state’s legal response as the crisis became pandemic in scope, 3) how a state enacts and enforces isolation, quarantine, and shelter in place orders, and 4) the rights of the public during these unprecedented government actions. The application of state law in the time of public health emergencies has historic precedent and will continue to evolve as does COVID-19."

I argue that withdrawing kids and younger people from schools and Universities and leaving them at home is the proper procedure to decrease the chance of such undesirable adaptive shift becomes a reality."

La carrera por ver quién es el primero que publica resultados positivos sobre el COVID-19 está llevando a las revistas a publicar resultados de mala calidad y de dudosa credibilidad. Se ha realizado un pequeño estudio sobre la investigación del COVID-19. Hemos realizado una búsqueda bibliográfica en la base de datos Pubmed (MEDLINE) para estudios indexados hasta el 18 de marzo de 2020 sobre COVID-19. Se ha realizado un análisis bibliométrico de la producción científica, con indicadores bibliométricos básicos y se seleccionado de forma independiente la literatura de los trabajos publicados con mayor ""Altmetric Attention Score"" (indicador obtenido en https://www.altmetric.com/) para evaluar la calidad de los estudios mediante la lectura de título, resumen y descriptor, para identificar los principales hallazgos asociados con la infección grave por COVID-19. El análisis de datos textuales de los resultados, se desarrolló mediante el método de las comparaciones constantes. <em>La Estrategia de búsqueda empleada:</em> [""SARS-CoV-2""[Title/Abstract] OR ""SARSCoV2""[Title/Abstract] OR ""2019-nCoV""[Title/Abstract] OR ""covid-19""[Title/Abstract] OR ""covid19""[Title/Abstract] OR ""Hcov-19""[Title/Abstract] OR ""novel coronavirus"" [Title/Abstract] OR ""Coronavirus Disease 2019"" OR ""new coronavirus""[Title/Abstract] OR (wuhan AND coronavirus)] Se han identificado 2057 estudios donde el 47% de las investigaciones (986) se han publicado en revistas de impacto, de las cuales el 64% de esas publicaciones en revistas de impacto corresponden a revistas del primer cuartil (636 registros), es decir, el 30% del total de las investigaciones están publicados en revistas de primer cuartil. Además, el 20% corresponden a publicaciones en revistas del primer decil (429) y el 13% corresponde a publicaciones en revistas TOP 3 (282). Hay que destacar que el 98% de las publicaciones ha recibido al menos una mención en redes sociales, lo que pone de manifiesto la importancia del tema. Los resultados de las investigaciones en las revistas New England Journal of Medicine, The Lancet, JAMA: Journal of the American Medical Association y Science han sido los más difundidos a través de las redes sociales. Como principales conclusiones destacamos que hasta la fecha existen multitud de publicaciones sobre el tema, muchas de ellas preprint. Hay incluso revisiones sistemáticas, pero recordemos, que una buena revisión sistemática requiere al menos de 61 semanas de preparación, aproximadamente debe contar con 5 personas para la revisión y además debe incluir en promedio, el 3% de los artículos seleccionados. Muchos de los trabajos identificados muestran una información errónea y prematura sobre el COVID-19, quizás porque los investigadores se sienten atraídos por el sensacionalismo en lugar de producir resultados validados que requieren tiempo. Destacar que del total de la producción científica identificada, apenas 14 estudios corresponden a trabajos españoles."
Zenodo,10.5281/zenodo.3738124,2020-04-02,COVID-19: can glutathione (GSH) help to reduce severe symptoms?,"Currently, the prevalent approach to decrease the number of deaths by SARS-CoV-2 is to contain the spread of the virus by reducing interpersonal contacts and, hence, the number of infected people. An alternative strategy could involve the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the known risk factors (old age, sex, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, or cancer, former smokers, etc) and to correct them, when possible, as a prevention/treatment of the disease. The decrease of glutathione (GSH) is one of the biochemical alterations identified up to now as being linked to the risk factors. Here, we discuss how GSH can mitigate the inflammatory response of the host, specific for the SARS-CoV-2 and dependent on its binding to its receptor ACE2, and we also suggest how to increase GSH levels to prevent and subdue the disease."

Zenodo,10.5281/zenodo.3669423,2020-02-17,Identifying patients from a large number of people by a small number of tests,"For many diseases, patients need to be screened to determine whether they are ill or not. An approach, termed “Merged Testing for Recursive Groups (MTRG)”, is proposed for screening patients from more people with less tests. It can be used for various diseases, and one of the direct application is the suppression of pandemic (e.g., coronavirus pneumonia). In this approach, people are divided into several groups, and each group has multiple people. For each group, the samples (e.g., respiratory secretions) of all the people are mixed to generate a merged sample. All the people can be excluded if the merged sample indicates no illness. If the merged sample indicates illness, the group will be divided into smaller groups, and then handled recursively in the same way. By doing so, negative groups are excluded gradually, and the group size becomes smaller and smaller. Finally, each group has only one person. This approach is especially suitable for the case when only small percentage of people are ill (e.g., infected)."
Zenodo,10.5281/zenodo.3748303,2020-04-11,"Immunological mechanisms explaining the role of IgE, mast cells, histamine, elevating ferritin, IL-6, D-dimer, VEGF levels in COVID-19 and dengue, potential treatments such as mast cell stabilizers, antihistamines, Vitamin C, hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin and azithromycin","A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 was identified in Wuhan, China. The disease caused by the virus can range in severity from asymptomatic to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and death. Primary dengue infection results in IgE mediated sensitization against dengue virus (DENV) proteins. These IgE bind to receptors on mast cells. Upon subsequent exposure to the antigen recognized by the IgE, mast cell degranulation occurs releasing mediators such as histamine. Therefore secondary dengue infection results in urticaria, increased vascular permeability, hypotension, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). A case of “slow rolling anaphylaxis”. Since vaccines contain animal proteins derived from animals infected with any number of viral diseases, one could develop IgE mediated sensitization to numerous viral proteins including coronavirus proteins. Therefore, receipt of such vaccines acts like a dengue “primary infection”. It results in IgE mediated sensitization directed against coronavirus proteins. Once sensitized, a SARS-CoV-2 infection therefore now becomes the equivalent of a secondary dengue infection and similarly can have a severe course for the same reason - IgE mediated mast cell degranulation and the immune cascade that follows. There are many common observations between COVID-19 and dengue. Elevated levels of ferritin, interleukin-6 (IL-6)⁠, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), D-dimer, coagulopathy, urticaria and ARDS are reported in both diseases. There are many indicators that mast cell degranulation and histamine release may have a major role in COVID-19 and dengue severity. Mast cell stabilizers, antihistamines, Vitamin C, HCQ, azithromycin, ivermectin may address different aspects of this cascade and thus reduce disease severity. Disease mechanisms and immunopathology must be understood. Focusing on anti-viral action of drugs alone could be counter productive. For example, CQ had no effect on viraemia but decreased cases of DHF."

Zenodo,10.5281/zenodo.3733457,2020-03-30,Mask Is a Double-edged Sword in the Fight Against COVID-19 Pandemic,"The COVID-19 pandemic has become out of control. To determine whether the lack of protection of lungs is a factor for the rapidly increasing infected population, we constructed a mask use model and analyzed how viral particles behavior. We found that mask can prevent viral particles from crossing it, reduce oxygen uptake efficiency, raise inlet air temperature, and increase resistance to breathing. We found that uninfected people should wear masks in any closed public building where viral particles from infected persons are expected to exist; that masks can dramatically aggravate disease severity on infected persons; that use of masks by infected persons is justified only if cross-infection and successive infections from external viral sources outweigh the expected harm; that people with unknown infection status should exercise due care. We further found at this point no fast measure can break the chain of infection, social distancing rule is insufficient, and wearing masks is the only effective remedy for interim protection. We found that World Health Organization’s rules on the use of masks are largely incorrect, and so are the rules of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. We predicted that those rules have dramatically increased severe infection incidence rate, and have made COVID disease of infected persons much severer. We personally noted that a big percent of Americans still do not wear masks in closed public areas, and leave the most lethal transmission route open. If masks are not correctly used, the U.S. and many Western nations will sustain the worst damages in all aspects from human life and economic activities."
Zenodo,10.5281/zenodo.3738451,2020-04-02,Novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and Airborne Microplastics,"Of current concern to global health is the emergence of a novel human coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causing severe respiratory tract infections in humans. Person to person and surface contact have been fingered as the major transmission route of SARS-CoV-2. The ability of virus to survive in the environment is a critical factor in viral transmission. Recent researches have shown that the virus can survive on surface of plastics up to 5 days under room temperature and in aerosol for up to 3 hours. Therefore this research opinion proposes that SARS-CoV-2 can be accommodated in formed viral biofilms on microplastics surfaces and can thus be deposited over longer distances (&gt; 100 km), than is currently being thought to be, since microplastics are airborne over long distances. This pathway should be studied by scientist as it may provide insight on why some region experienced the outbreak with no trace/history of visit or contact by an infected person. As there are currently no specific therapies for SARS-CoV-2, we therefore proposed that total lockdown (which have also reduced global anthropogenic activities) is perhaps in the best interest of mankind."
